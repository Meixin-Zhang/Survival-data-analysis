# Survival-data-analysis
## _BIOSTAT 537 at UW_
In most human studies conducted inpublic health, the outcome of interest is not observed on all study participants for a variety of reasons, including drop-outor due to individuals moving in and out of the study population. The broad goal of survival analysis is to addressscientific queries about a time-to-event distributionwhile appropriately accounting for the data incompleteness that often characterizespublic health data. This course covers the foundations of survival analysis, with a particular emphasis on topics relevant to epidemiology, public health and medicine. The coursewill covernonparametric and semiparametric techniques along with common parametric approaches. A substantial portion of the course is devoted toregressionmethods for survival outcome data, withmultiplicative models beingemphasized.

The course covers:
- Parameter Models
- Survival Function: Kaplan-Meier Method
- Hazard Function: Proportional Hazards Model
- Non-parametric estimates of difference between groups: Cox Proportional Hazard Ratio Test
- The log-rank test
- Truncation: censoring and delayed entry
- Time varying covariates
